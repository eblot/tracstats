Underneath this\r\ntab can be found statistics about changesets, wiki pages, and tickets.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n\r\n* Recent activity (last 30 days) showing top 10 developers, projects, and paths\r\n  within the repository.\r\n\r\n* Detailed statistics of source code development:\r\n\r\n  * Total files by time\r\n  * Commits by time, author, month, day of week, hour of day\r\n  * Recent commits\r\n  * Activity by time, author, project, filetype, change type\r\n  * Most active paths, files\r\n  * Commit cloud (built from checkin comments)\r\n\r\n* Detailed statistics of Trac wiki pages:\r\n\r\n  * Total pages by time\r\n  * Edits by author\r\n  * Latest wiki pages changed\r\n  * Most active wiki pages\r\n  * Largest wiki pages\r\n\r\n* Detailed statistics of Trac tickets:\r\n\r\n  * Open tickets by time\r\n  * Tickets by author, component\r\n  * Most active tickets\r\n  * Oldest open tickets\r\n  * Latest tickets reported, changed\r\n\r\n* Drill down by author or path within the repository for more information.\r\n\r\nThe TracStats plugin supports Trac installations with SQLite, MySQL, and\r\nPostgreSQL database backends.\r\n\r\nThe TracStats plugin has been tested with Subversion, Mercurial, and Git\r\nversion control systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe TracStats plugin can be installed using standard:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install tracstats\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, grab the sources and build using:\r\n \r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nIt is configured in the ``trac.ini`` file by enabling and configuring:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[components]\r\ntracstats.* = enabled\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ``STATS_VIEW`` permission is used to control access to the statistics pages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, an optional \"project root\" within your repository can be\r\nconfigured as the base for all projects and source code statistics:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[stats]\r\nroot = path/to/projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nIf you use Git (i.e. the GitPlugin for Trac) and are not able to see any of\r\nthe code statistics, you likely need to configure it to cache the repository\r\nto make it work:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[git]\r\ncached_repository = true\r\npersistent_cache = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might need to run ``trac-admin <project-env> repository resync <reponame>`` after the change.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
